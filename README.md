# 📚 AI Study Tip Generator

This is a simple web tool that uses OpenAI's GPT model to generate helpful study tips on demand.

## 🔧 How It Works

- Built using **HTML**, **JavaScript**, and **OpenAI GPT-3.5**
- Click a button → sends request to ChatGPT API → displays a smart study tip

## 🧪 Features

- Clean UI
- Quick response from AI
- Great for students looking for motivation or strategies

## ⚠️ Warning

This version uses the API key directly in the frontend. That means:
> **DO NOT share your live link publicly unless the API key is protected.**
